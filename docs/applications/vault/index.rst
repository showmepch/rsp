vault â€” Secret Storage
######################

Vault provides the storage for secrets which are materialized into
Phalanx applications as Kubernetes Secrets.

It is simply the `Official Hashicorp Helm chart for Vault <https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm>`__ configured the way we require.

It is intended to run under Roundtable, and there should only be one production and one development instance per organization-with-its-own-secret-store.

The Vault Agent Injector is not enabled since we instead use the :doc:`Vault Secrets Operator <../vault-secrets-operator/index>`.

Vault is configured in HA mode with a public API endpoint accessible at ``vault.lsst.cloud``, or ``vault-dev.lsst.cloud`` for the development instance.
TLS termination is done at the nginx ingress layer using a Let's Encrypt server certificate.

To directly manipulate the secrets stored in this Vault instance, use `lsstvaultutils <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lsstvaultutils>`__ .
However, in normal operation, secrets will be managed via each application's ``secrets.yaml`` and manual interaction with Vault and its data will not be necessary.
