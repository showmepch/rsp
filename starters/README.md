# Helm starters for Phalanx

Each subdirectory of this directory is a Helm starter for a class of Phalanx service.
These are used by the `phalanx application create` command.

For example, from the top of a Phalanx checkout:

```sh
phalanx application create --starter fastapi-safir <application>
```
